		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Audio Processing with PyDub",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down audio processing into format handling, mixing logic, volume control, and duration management subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Requires handling multiple audio formats (mp3/wav), implementing overlay logic with volume adjustments, and ensuring duration synchronization. Complexity arises from format dependencies (ffmpeg) and audio mixing precision[1][3][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Image Processing with OpenCV",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate image loading, resizing, aspect ratio handling, and padding implementation into distinct subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Involves OpenCV operations for resizing and padding, but complexity is moderate due to standard library functions. Challenges include maintaining aspect ratios and handling different image formats[4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Raw Video Creation from Images with MoviePy",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into duration calculation, image sequence handling, and frame rate configuration subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Timing synchronization between audio and images requires precise duration calculations. Complexity comes from managing frame rates and image sequence transitions[4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Audio-Video Merging with MoviePy",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for audio-video synchronization and error handling",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward with MoviePy's set_audio method, but requires ensuring duration alignment between components[4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Final Video Export with MoviePy",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate codec configuration and export error handling into subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Depends on FFmpeg availability and codec compatibility. Complexity stems from managing encoding parameters and error recovery[4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Main Orchestration Script",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into argument parsing, workflow orchestration, and logging/error handling subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Requires integrating multiple components while managing dependencies and error states. Complexity comes from pipeline coordination and edge case handling[4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Video Concatenation and Transitions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing video concatenation with transitions into smaller, manageable steps. Consider subtasks for setting up the environment/library, implementing basic concatenation, adding specific transition types (e.g., fade, crossfade), handling sequences of transitions, and writing comprehensive tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex media processing using external libraries (MoviePy/FFmpeg), requiring understanding of video formats, codecs, and timing. Implementing transitions adds algorithmic complexity. Breaking it down into setup, basic concatenation, specific transition types, sequence handling, and testing is crucial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add URL input support for media files",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of adding URL input support into distinct implementation steps: planning the integration and temporary file strategy, implementing the URL detection and download logic, managing temporary file creation and cleanup, integrating the download process into the main processing script (`create_video.py`), implementing robust error handling and validation for downloads, writing comprehensive tests covering various scenarios (valid URLs, invalid URLs, network issues, cleanup), and refining the temporary file management and error handling based on testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant complexity due to the introduction of external network operations (downloading files), the need for robust error handling for potential network issues and invalid inputs, secure management and cleanup of temporary files, and seamless integration into the existing file-based processing pipeline. Breaking it down into planning, core logic implementation, resource management (temp files), integration, error handling, and testing is crucial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Pipeline for Batch Processing and Concatenation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of refactoring the video creation pipeline for batch processing and concatenation into actionable subtasks. Include steps for setting up the new input method (argparse, JSON), refactoring the core processing logic into a reusable function, implementing the iteration and temporary file management loop, integrating the concatenation step, handling final output and cleanup, adding comprehensive logging and error handling, and developing/executing the test plan.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant refactoring of the core video processing script to handle multiple inputs via a structured format (JSON array). It requires integrating several existing components (single-cut processing, concatenation), managing temporary files, implementing robust error handling, and adding new input parsing logic. The dependencies on multiple previous tasks also contribute to its complexity as an integration point."
